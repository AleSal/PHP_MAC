# PHP_MAC
PHP script that gets mac from LAN connected computers when accessing the page. 

After a long search over the web for some script that could get the correct mac address of clients trying to connect to my
PfSense Captive Portal and finding a lot of lines that didn't worked, I wrote this, works on any server with any device connected to the network. 


Feel free to use it as you wish, don't forget to check the upgraded version here:
